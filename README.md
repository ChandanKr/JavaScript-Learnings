# **Interview Questions:**


#### **1.** What is difference between _null_ and _undefined_ ?
#### **Ans:** In JavaScript, null and undefined are both used to represent the absence of a meaningful value, but they have different meanings and behaviors:
- **_null_** is an explicit value that represents a variable or object that has no value or is empty. It's a way to "empty" a variable or reset it.
- **_undefined_** means that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value yet.

```
var iAmUseless = null
console.log(iAmUseless); //null, here iAmUseless is an object
```
```
var iAmOnStandBy;
console.log(iAmOnStandBy); // undefined
```
