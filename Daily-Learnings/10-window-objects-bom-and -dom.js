//! Window Object:
   //* The window object represents the global window in a browser.
   //* Both BOM (Browser Object Model) and DOM (Document Object Model) are part of the window object.

//! BOM (Browser Object Model):
   //* The BOM represents the browser as an object and provides methods and properties for interacting with the browser itself (not directly related to the content of a web page).

   //* Examples of BOM features include window.navigator for browser URL information, window.location for URL manipulation and window.alert for displaying alerts.

//! DOM (Document Object Model):
   //* The DOM represents the structured document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (such as element, attributes, and text).

   //* The DOM is primarily concerned with the content of the web page and allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the HTML elements.

   //* The DOM provides multiple properties and methods to dynamically change the content of the HTML document using JavaScript.


//? CONCLUSION:
   //* The BOM is focused on the browser environment.
   //* The DOM is focused on the content of the page.
   //* The window object serves as the global object that encompasses both the BOM and the DOM when working in a browser environment.
